                <p class = "item3">
                    Bubble tea began life in Taiwan in the 1980’s, before spreading around the countries of East Asia 
                    and it wasn’t long before people began taking their favourite snack drink to Australia, the USA and 
                    here in Canada

                    Many people think the little balls at the bottom, often called boba, are the origin of the name 
                    'bubble tea', but in fact it comes from the frothy little bubbles which are made when we shake the 
                    drink to mix it all up to perfection.

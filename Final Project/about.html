            <!-- Discusses the history of bubble tea -->
            <p class = "item3">
                Bubble tea began life in Taiwan in the 1980’s, before spreading around the countries of East Asia 
                and it wasn’t long before people began taking their favourite snack drink to Australia, the USA and 
                here in Canada

                Many people think the little balls at the bottom, often called boba, are the origin of the name 
                'bubble tea', but in fact it comes from the frothy little bubbles which are made when we shake the 
                drink to mix it all up to perfection.
            </p>

                In addition to our large selection of teas, we also offer a lovely selection of ice-creams. Ranging
                from a simple, natural vanilla to a grand ube ice-cream with a hint of edible gold, we have it all.

            <h3 id = "item1"> What is Tapioca Boba? </h3>
            <p id = "item2">
                Tapioca boba come from the cassava root starch, brown sugar and caramel; they have a chewy 
                gummy texture.
            </p>

            <h3 id = "item3"> What are Jellies made from? </h3>
            <p id = "item4">
                Our tea jellies are made from fresh produce such as strawberries, mango, and aloe vera
            </p>

            <h3 id = "item5"> What is Popping Boba? </h3>
            <p id = "item6">
                Popping boba look like tapioca boba but instead have juice in them and will pop in your mouth. They are really tasty 
                and a great alternative to tapioca or jellies, and are vegan friendly.
            </p>

            <h3 id = "item7"> Do I need to add Boba in my Bubble Tea? </h3>

                Of course not, it is entirely optional. You are in charge of creating your masterpiece, and we simply compose them 
                for you
            </p>

            <h3 id = "item9"> Are your products vegan friendly? </h3>
            <p id = "item10">
                Yes. All of our products are suitable for vegans.
            </p>

            <h3 id = "item11"> What's the Difference Between Green and Black Tea? </h3>
            <p id = "item12">
                Both come from the same plant but go through different processing. The big difference is black tea has more caffeine.
